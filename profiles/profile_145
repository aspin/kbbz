Not a morning person.\n7. My taste in music is all over the place. \n8. I'm a very bubbly, outgoing and happy individual. \n9. I don't have any plans to leave Calgary. I love it here!\n10. Eminem has the ability to solve all my problems.\n11. I really want a Mazda 3 or a Nissan Juke as my next vehicle.\n12. The Olive Garden has always been my favourite restaurant.\n13. I really want to learn how to cook. Someone buy me a cookbook! \n14. I was born in Manitoba. \n15. I'm going to get a pomsky puppy one day. They're adorable!\n16. I rolled my first car in a back alley 9 days after I got the keys. \n17. I went down to Colorado for 5 months after I graduated. \n18. I've spent over 20 weeks of my life in California. \n19. These past 2 months have been the most emotionally draining in my life.\n20. I'm going to be turning 20 next month (and I'm really excited because I feel like the 20's is where it all begins).  \n21. This is my lucky number.\n22. I've met some of the best people in my life since I've started school.
