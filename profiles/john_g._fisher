[u'we are keeping a friend of Trevors at our home because her mother threw her out on the street for arguing with her. No physical harm. It is illegal to throw even an 18 year out of a home because they have rights. How can a parent do that? She had to sleep in a sleeping bag outside one night at her home. Now she is talking with her mom to work things out. Are we dealing with a used car or someones life, how much time?  Just remember when her Mom is in a nursing home and no one comes to visit......pay back time......there is a lot of mental health issues out there that appear as unusual behavior, but when it has this type of affect on other person, their own child, this is very bad.  The sad part is the person doing the harm has lost all their compassion and that is a very big sign. No bed, clothes, food, money, no place to go. I hope her Mom reads this and takes a long hard look at herself and thinks down the road. I need to help this child......need all your thoughts and ideas..', 2, u'2012-09-26T10:47:24+0000']

[u'Last week I had a job of carrying Boeing people around. They flew in the new 787 dreamliner to Rockford for the Hamilton-Sunstrand employees to see. It looks like a 737 with a widebody. The plane body is made of carbon-fiber and is 20% more fuel efficient than any plane in its class. It now holds the world record for the longest non stop flight of an airliner on one load of fuel, over 9000 miles. Look it up on google and check out the cool cabin and cockpit. It even has a sleeper berth above the cockpit for a second set of pilots for the long flights. You can have one too for around $200 million or 400 new MCI motorcoaches.....How do they make money.....fly it round the clock with $1,000 seats....by the way it seats about 250 depending on the seat configuration....', 0, u'2012-01-30T13:49:18+0000']
[u'It is Sunday morning the 8th of January. I am sitting in the Fairfield Inn in Mobile, Alabama with Football Fans From Norther Illinois Univ.. Their team is playing in the Go Daddy. Com Bowl versus Arkansas State from Jonesboro, Arkansas. We arrived a little before 1pm yesterday. Three Buses. I rode down to a town in Kentunky Friday with 5 other drivers. We have two drivers per bus because of the extremely late hours we are on the road. The fans were driven to us and we took over about 2 am on Sat morning. It is 550 miles from there to here. We drove thru Nasheville, Tn, Huntsville, Al, (There is Saturn Rocket standing at the first rest area in Alabama because it is the major city for NASA.) Birmingham, Al and Montgomery, Al.. Told the kids about Rosa Parks, the Selma march and Dr. Kings first Church there and the Montgomery Bus Boycott. It was 77 degrees when we arrived. Forcast today is in the mid 70s. The game is being televised at 8pm tonight. Very evenly matched, high scoring teams so it should be a great game to watch. We leave immediatel after the game. We have not decided who will drive first. We take Interstate 65 all the way to Ky and the other drivers take it all the way to Gary, IN where it ends at I-90/80/94. A little background, I have drove the NIU Football the past 6 seasons so I know the team and University well. Slept 13 hours last night and feel refreshed, but it will be a long night. That is why we have team drivers to get 3 on 3 off and keep the other guy in great spirits. It is very wooded all the way from Indiana so it is a very boring drive. There are some good sized hills in N. Alabama, TN and KY.. The good part of the South is that it warm in winter, but the summers are unbearable. 90 days plus of over 90 degrees and 100 is common. We complain about the cold, but you can put more clothes on. 100 degrees is so bad with high humidities that you either escape or suffer continuosly. Fans just move the hot sticky air. Everyone has A.C. and spend most of the summer inside. It may get down to the mid 80s at night....no thanks....stay warm....latter...Johjn', 0, u'2012-01-08T15:23:00+0000']

[u'I took the flight crew to their jet this morning in Rockford. The Ukranian version of the Antonov 124 cargo plane. It is larger that a C5. Carries up 330,000 lbs of cargo with a gross weight of just under 900,000 lbs. There were two planes and they are trying to see if the runway is large enough to carry cargo in there versus O Hare. Check it out in Wekipedia. They let me climb up to carry bay, and then climb another 20 feet to the flight deck. 400,000 horsepower. It can carry three M 1 tanks at 50 tons each...or the weight of 9 empty 45 foot motorcoaches. I drove the bus within 30 feet of the plane and unloaded all the supplies the crew bought to bring back home to the Ukaine. I would have never imagined to see these in of all places, Rockford, Ill..', 0, u'2011-12-30T00:32:39+0000']
[u'football update; Took Northern Ill. Univ football to Bowling Green University last night and they won 45-14. Last week I took them to play Toledo Univ. and NIU won 63 - 60 and thought that this will be a once in a liftetime score....that is like 17 touchdowns and a couple field goals in regulation time. Last night Toledo played Western Michigan at home and won 66 to 63.....unbelievable......now think of this Toledo allowed 126 points in two games and scored 126 points in two games....great offense, lousy defense....check it out at the MAC conference website......score 63 points and lose........drove through the night to get the team and myself back....luckily missed all the bad weather.....next time on the Bus Driver Line....John', 0, u'2011-11-09T22:54:20+0000']
[u'I saw a College football game Monday night in Toledo, Ohio.  A team score 60 points and lose!!!! Yes, Northern Illinois beat Toledo 63-60 in a shoot-out of the century. About 16 touchdowns and a couple field goals.. Over 1100 total yards of offense and over 1000 yards of return yards....broke a MAC conference scoring record without going into overtime....it was a great track meet....I mean football game. It is great to have a happy team get into the bus versus a sad one......Central Michigan game several weeks ago...no fun...funeral home.....all the way home....in this case we (4 buses) took them to the airport and they flew home so they can go to class Wed...we drove the 300 miles home empty the next day.......next week the same time and almost the same place, Bowling Green, Ohio (30 miles South of Toledo)...watch it on ESPN 2...NIU is a high scoring offense, should be another great game....bad part, have to drive them back to Dekalb, should get there between 4 and 5am........Oh well....it is a good job with a lot of fun stuff.....could write a book on what I have seen in the past 5 years....', 0, u'2011-11-03T12:24:04+0000']
