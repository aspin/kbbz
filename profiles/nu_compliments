[u"Hey guys-\nIt's been a great year. Friends were made, tears were occasionally shed, and yes, the Gator Bowl was won. Some things stayed the same: Sargent still awaits a renovation, Willie is still a Wildcat, and Morty is still a fucking boss. But 2012 - 2013 was honestly like no year before; soon, Northwestern will bring in a new batch of freshman and say good-bye to a passionate group of seniors. And as times move along, even Facebook compliment pages can lose their luster.\n\nStarting this page was honestly a shot in the dark for me- a stray idea while wasting away on Facebook on a random Tuesday. The details aren't particularly important (such as the inordinate amount of time I spent spamming the Facebook friend finder) but in the end, the results are overwhelming. 1,346 compliments posted, all from the kindness of you guys. Brought tears to my eyes when that number popped up. Give yourself a pat on the back for being kind, being honest, and most importantly, being yourself. \n\nA couple last notes, if you will. First off, the reason Northwestern is such a good school is because of the students; don't let anyone tell you differently. Support each other, because you're probably paying it forward. Also, a BIG thank-you to my partners-in-crime: two great guys who helped out in so many ways while I was going through a hectic winter quarter. Can't forget about my gurl Sherman Ave keeping my spirits up, as well as the irrepressible fellow NU pages. \n\nLast but not least, I want to ask a small request: when this page is just a memory, don't forget to keep complimenting your friends, your family, your professors, your random acquaintances. Thanks, and have a great summer.\n\n- NU Compliments", 236, u'2013-06-21T17:06:28+0000']

[u'Dani Swaiman is one of the most selfless and caring people I have met here at Northwestern. She is a loyal friend and is always there to listen. I have been so lucky to get to know her better this quarter and witness all of the amazing qualities that she has to offer. I love her so much and know that everyone else feels the same.', 25, u'2013-04-22T03:04:23+0000']
[u'Dancing with Elise Mattenson is more energizing than any amount of caffeine. I never thought a cat daddy could inspire so many people, but of course she made it happen. Twerk on, my friend, and know that we will dearly miss you on the DM stage both as the 30-hour-dance teacher and Fusion performer.', 13, u'2013-04-22T03:03:47+0000']
[u"Melissa Yanan doesn't know that she is absolutely incredible. She's beautiful, smart, hilarious, and quirky as hell. I wish that see could see past everything holding her back and know that she is a truly wonderful person, inside and out.", 35, u'2013-04-22T03:03:13+0000']
[u'A HUGE thank you to each and every person involved in Dance Marathon. You made my first DM a very special experience that I will hold dear to my heart forever. We changed lives and helped in the mission to save millions who suffer from epilepsy. "Light will guide you home" and "who\'s going to save the world tonight?"\u2026this is a start. Danny Did and we can too. Thank you!\n\nEditor\'s Note: Sorry for the lateness!', 22, u'2013-04-22T03:02:39+0000']

[u'Darcy Rose is the most huggable. She does it all and she still manages to be the sweetest, most lovable person. If I could cradle her in my arms as I went about my week, classes would suddenly become more sunny.', 11, u'2013-04-22T03:00:20+0000']
[u'Olivia Cygan is one of the most kindhearted and sweet people around, and an amazingly talented actress to boot. Her presence just makes your day better.', 31, u'2013-04-20T21:44:04+0000']
