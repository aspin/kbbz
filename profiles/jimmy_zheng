You inspire students all over campus to take ACTION towards one UNITED goal: to create a better future for the Bruin community. This is all that matters at the end of the day. Prepare yourself, UCLA. Tonight marks the start of an era of progress and future-building. Your next year USAC Council Members are going to make real change. You just wait.\n\nAvi Oved, you deserve the IVP position more than anyone. Your passion and resilience constitute the qualities of a true leader. I am so honored to have worked so closely with you on your campaign. Thank you for humbling me and allowing me to thrive in student government.\n\nLastly, THANK YOU to all those who voted for student government. You expressed your voice - your collective agency - and elected a panel of amazing leaders. Learn about them; meet them; understand them; talk to them.
