But teach him also that For every scoundrel there is a hero; That for every selfish politician, There is a dedicated leader.. Teach him for every enemy there is a friend,\n\nSteer him away from envy, If you can, Teach him the secret of quit laughter.\n Let him learn early that the bullies are the easiest to lick\u2026 teach him, if you can, The wonder of books. But also give him quiet time to ponder the eternal mystery of birds in the sky, Bees and the sun, And the flowers on a green hillside.\n\nIn the school teach him, it is far more honorable to fail\nThan to cheat. Teach him to have faith\nIn his own ideas, Even if everyone tells him they are wrong.\nTeach him to be gentle with gentle people, and tough with the tough.\n\nTry to give my son the strength not to follow the crowd when everyone is getting on the band wagon. Teach him to listen to all men. But teach him also to filter all he hears on a screen of truth, and take only the good that comes through.\n\nTeach him if you can, how to laugh when he is sad. Teach him there is no shame in tears, teach him to scoff at cynics and to beware of too much sweetness. Teach him to sell his brawn and brain to the highest bidders but never to put a price-tag on his heart and soul.\n\nTeach him to close his ears to a howling mob and to stand and fight if he thinks he\u2019s right. Treat him gently, but do not cuddle him, because only the test of fire makes fine steel.\n\nLet him have the courage to be impatient. Let him have the patience to be brave. Teach him always to have sublime faith in himself, because then he will have sublime faith in mankind.\n\nThis is a big order, but see what you can do. He is such a fine fellow, my son!', 12, u'2013-11-11T19:26:50+0000']
