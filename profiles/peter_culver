[u'In 2011, Missouri University swimmer Sasha Menu Courey committed suicide, which is a terrible tragedy in and of itself. However, a year before she died, she was raped by a football player. In the following months, she told two doctors and an athletic department administrator about the rape, which was followed by... nothing. Absolutely nothing. This is sickening. MU athletic department spokesman Chad Moller and MU president Tim Wolfe have both claimed that the Outside the Lines story that initially reported the story was "skewed and unfair, and "went to great lengths to paint the university in a bad light." No. Just no. \n\nAs much as I wish that this was an isolated incident, the exception to the norm, it\'s not. In 2000, University of Washington tight end Jerramy Stevens was not charged for the rape of a fellow student. Last year, the rape charges against Heisman winner Jameis Winston were dropped due to a "lack of evidence," which led to the victim promising to file suit against the  Tallahassee police for an inadequate investigation. \n\nThis country needs to wake up. You cannot put the well-being of your football team ahead of the safety and well-being of the rest of your university. The fact that UM is just now racing to investigate the case only serves to further insult the memory of Menu Courey. The university\'s reasoning for not following charges was that "her account was not clear." This is patently ridiculous. The fact that she mentions the fact she was raped accompanied by the fact that another football player corroborated her story is more than enough to warrant an investigation. \n\nOpen your eyes, Tim Wolfe. Accept the fact that you should have investigated this earlier, and carry on with your procedure. Get the police involved. Stop trying to protect your football team, and protect your students instead. Thank you.', 20, u'2014-01-27T03:53:14+0000']

The economy suffered from strict trade embargoes, activists were either killed or held against their will for years, and the Western world was rising up in protest. Then, in 1994, Nelson Mandela led the African National Congress to victory in the first multi-racial elections since before World War II, marking the end of one of the most painful pieces of recent African history. Today, the world has lost a great man in Nelson Mandela, a flag-bearer of democracy and equality for all, no matter the color of your skin. Some denounce him as a communist sympathizer who should not be recognized in a positive light.

Instead, they decided to take a cheap shot at the Obama administration with something that was not his fault. This is a day of remembrance and respect to those who lost their lives on this day.
