Darkness is the beasts best friend, the two intimately working together to bring the beast ever closer to its goal.

Then the beast goes still for a moment as its prey wanders near, muscles like coiled springs. Then as swift as a flash of lightning and making no more noise then wind rustling leaves, the beast secures its kill. A successful hunt.
