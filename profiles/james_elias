[u'James Hoggatt said this in reference to gun violence in our community and I couldn\'t agree more:\n\n"Dear Sweet Assault Rifle Toting Jesus:\n\nLiberals: Please stop making anti 2nd amendment arguments. Its not good policy, nor does it actually solve the problem. 2nd amendment doesn\'t kill people, poor gun access laws, horrific lack of gun training, and poor background check systems are what cause mass shootings. But beyond that, mass shootings aren\'t the issue, gun violence in general is the issue, particularly the use of specific type of weapons in violent crime that makes criminals unafraid of police involvement. Want an easy win issue? Go after high caliber handguns. They do nothing but kill cops. \n\nConservatives: Please stop pretending that guns aren\'t a really big factor in gun violence. If there ever is a point where chainsaws stop being used to cut stuff, and instead are primarily used to kill people I guarantee you the liberals who are making gun control arguments will be the first to say, "Regulate chainsaws". The question isn\'t a question of whether liberals believe guns by their nature are evil, no tool by its nature is evil, instead the question is does the tool amplify the evil of a person in a way that it becomes tremendously powerful and deadly. Can microwaves be used as a murder weapon? Absolutely. Is the amplification of evil of a person set to kill a group of people or rob a store wielding a microwave anything close to that of a person wielding a gun? Absolutely not. \n\nLibs and Conservatives, just shut the holy fuck up. You are not each other\'s enemy. Criminals are the enemy. Libs stop calling Conservatives evil gun obsessed idiots. Conservatives, please stop trying to compare guns to inanimate objects that have a clear and unquestioned purpose other than killing, because its betraying the fact that you have real arguments to bring to the table and its just dumb.\n\nStart where you can agree, ask questions. Here, let me start:\n\nConservatives:\n\nWhy do we need 50 caliber handguns? \nWhy do you need more than 10 shots in a magazine? \n\nLiberals:\nWhy should the solution be eliminating a constitutional right instead of regulating the right like we did the first amendment? \nAre guns the issue? Or is the issue things like institutionalized racism, the cycle of poverty, and the fear culture bred by the media? Studies show that the problem of gun violence is primarily based on racial tension in the US. Can we focus on solving that and regulate instead of ban? \n\nSorry for the rant. I am allergic to bad argument."', 9, u'2012-12-24T04:26:01+0000']

[u"Happy Election Day!! Everyone who can vote, don't get too secure just because of what the polls say, instead you should go vote anyways. To my fellow Wisconsinites who support Obama, I say this: We marched to the capital of this great State in an effort to undo a wronging of the people; however we caused this wrong in the first place! Never get complacent about any election!!! The polls only can show us a victory if we get out, vote and MAKE IT A VICTORY. Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the United States of America!! It's time to elect the President that will give us four more years of change for the better and give him a chance to finish undoing EIGHT YEARS of wronging to this glorious country through political, social, economic and foreign policy choices!! My fellow Americans, it's time to re-elect Barack Obama as your President", 9, u'2012-11-06T12:19:07+0000']
