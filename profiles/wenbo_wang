Sure I could have gone to another college with no debt and extra thousands in my pocket. But as I sit here at 1 A.M doing homework for write the essay I am glad I picked NYU. I am blessed with new friends and new opportunities. Being elected President of Weinstein Hall is a huge honor and I thank all the people, including my entire floor, who were there to support me. Thank you Mathieu for designing my posters and Avia for being my campaign manager :) \nTo be honest it\u2019s just a great new start for my life here in the best city on earth. I now understand that New York University is the best University for me, and this is only the beginning.', 71, u'2013-09-16T05:42:11+0000']

[u"As I contemplate tonight, I look back on my four years. These years were difficult, unique, and defining. There is a lot I want to say to everyone. All the people in my life, all my friends, and teachers. \n\nBut there aren\u2019t enough words to describe how I feel. Our lives are intertwined with all of those around us, we share in a common experience. Our years in high school left a legacy, a legacy to be proud of.\n\nIn this legacy includes all the triumphs, all the failures, and regrets. But nevertheless it is the legacy that we made and in the end it is who we are. \n\nLegacies are defined, defined by friends who look out for you, who are happy for you when you succeed, comfort you when you are sad.  I could not have gotten by these four years without the friends I have made not only here, but from around the world. A truly diverse experience.\n\nNothing is forever, time passed, the sun sets. But the sun will rise again and so a new experience, a new day. Even as the years past, even as we change, our legacy remains. \n\nAs this day ends, a new one awaits, a new story to tell, a new legacy to be made. This is a story made by each and every one of us. So let us not dwell on the sadness of past memories, but be assured in our hearts of what we have. Of our friends. \n\nLet us take that with us to a brighter future. Let our friends inspire us, let our legacy guide us, and let our hearts led us to change the world. \n\nThank you all everyone, friends from Millard West, North, South, and across the world. Thank all for a great four years and all you've impacted on my life. So let us go forth, the world awaits!", 34, u'2013-05-25T05:17:43+0000']
