[u'People like Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning are not heroes. They betrayed the trust given them by the US government by making disclosures of top secret information. To people who say that the government surveillance is unethical and wrong, wake up. We live in a digital age. Anything you say or do on the internet is available to anyone looking for it. Not just the government but corporations as well. Look at the right side of this page and I guarantee you see an ad relating so something you recently viewed on the internet or a product you bought on amazon. What I\'m saying is that these days "privacy" doesn\'t mean what it used to. People say the government shouldn\'t be in our personal business and then ask where was the intelligence on the Boston Bombers. You can\'t have it both ways. Personally I will sacrifice some privacy if it means that the government can thwart another incident like the one in Boston. If you are unwilling to make that sacrifice then I recommend not using the internet or texting, send letters to your friends and family and only talk to them by payphone. Our government would be doing us a disservice if they DIDN\'T monitor digital communications. It\'s a digital age and our military and government intelligence agencies understand that. The people that would perpetrate acts like the bombings in Boston understand this as well and they are the ones benefiting the most from people like Snowden and Manning, not you. \n\nAs far as our government "spying" on the UN, well that one\'s a bit above my paygrade haha.', 9, u'2013-07-02T03:33:14+0000']
