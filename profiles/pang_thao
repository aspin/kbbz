I can\'t stop you from what you\'re ultimately deciding to do, all I can do is try to help you understand. And I admit, I\'m not the most upbeat, positively motivated, happy, etc person that I may appear to be all the time. I have my downs too. I, myself, have had countless thoughts about suicide, whatever, but that by no means says that I\'m going to go and do it because there is so much left of life to see.

Other people\'s death, those who die "naturally" and whatnot, their lives, it\'s their lives that should be teaching us to LIVE our lives to the FULLEST. But like I said, if you\'re going to do it then I can\'t stop you, I can only be there for you. But I cannot stress enough how stupid it is, how you shouldn\'t do it. You may think no one cares but how I see it, more people than you know care. They care so much. You\'ll only be leaving a HOLE in all our hearts. Especially mine. You may say "thank you" and that you "appreciate how much I\'ve been there for you" but how I see it, if you did, if you really did, you wouldn\'t want to do something so stupid... in all honesty, I don\'t even know what to say and/or do anymore - just know that I care and will always care', 10, u'2013-12-20T04:21:52+0000']
