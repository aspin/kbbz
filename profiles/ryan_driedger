[u'According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 88,000 people die every year due to excessive alcohol use making it the \u201cthird leading lifestyle-related cause of death in the nation.\u201d Short-term effects of alcohol use include: dehydration, violence, traffic injuries and deaths, accidental death, impaired judgment, sexually transmitted diseases, miscarriage, stillbirth and fetal defects in pregnant women and alcohol poisoning. Long-term health risks include dementia, stroke, neuropathy, social problems, psychiatric problems, cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, liver and breasts, hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver and gastrointestinal problems.\n\nNow lets take a look at tobacco. Also according to the CDC, cigarette smoking causes one in every five deaths in the United States each year, claiming approximately 440,000 lives directly and about 50,000 from second-hand smoke inhalation every year making it the leading cause of preventable death in the country. Short-term effects include yellowed teeth, nails and skin, decreased immunity, shortness of breath and respiratory difficulties. Long-term effects include coronary heart disease, a variety of cancers, premature aging, stillbirth, low birth-weight, heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and decreased bone density.\n\nBoth alcohol and tobacco are legal because we tolerate their widespread use. We tolerate their widespread use because we know prohibition only creates dangerous black markets and that education is a more valuable tool in managing these dangers. The prohibition of these substances would be more dangerous than permitting them. Many people can use these products casually and cause no harm to themselves or others. Furthermore, we enjoy the windfall of taxes both products generate because the market will bear a higher price for these luxury items.\n\nObama would also know, if he did his due diligence before making such an ignorant statement, that the \u201cdangers\u201d of cannabis are in no way comparable to either alcohol or tobacco. Approximately 0 people die of marijuana overdoses annually. Short-term effects of cannabis use include red eyes, dry mouth, increased appetite, distorted sense of time, paranoia and slowed reaction time. There are no proven negative long-term effects of cannabis use, however more and more studies are proving the positive effects of long-term use for people suffering form cancer, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Dementia, Crohn\u2019s Disease, Glaucoma, and many more fatal and chronic illnesses.\n\nWhen juxtaposed with alcohol and tobacco, Obama\u2019s statement would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t so willfully ignorant. He continued on to say \u201cIt\u2019s not something I encourage, and I\u2019ve told my daughters I think it\u2019s a bad idea, a waste of time, not very healthy.\u201d What kind of example is Mr. Obama setting for his daughters when he makes such sweeping statements and policy decisions based on opinions rather than facts? Legislating by opinion rather than fact is also how we ended up with slavery, Jim Crow Laws, a war in Iraq, alcohol prohibition and the availability of gun sales without a background check.\n\nIt\u2019s more than disappointing; it\u2019s frightening that Obama would make such statements propagating blatant misinformation when so many people can benefit from the economic boom of legalization and hemp production and the plethora of medical applications available from the cannabis plant.', 4, u'2014-01-27T22:23:35+0000']

[u'In canada only 13 ppl have ever passed the criteria for a Canadian conceal carry permit the one peace that 99.9% fail is (is police protection insufficient) the fact of the madder is if someone were to break into your home it would take them under a minute to reach your room and take your life even if u call 911 they still have to relay that to your local police and dispatch a unit to your aid, this on average takes 30 minutes, that\'s enough time for him to kill you rape your mother and your sister and then go for a smoke and that takes me to the second peace of criteria u need to pass ( are u in imminent danger) well what are you going to do? Wait until he\'s in your house and then send in you application? Come on, it\'s sad that people have let the government lie to them and tell them " the police are there to serve and protect" I disagree I think police are there to clean up the mess and catch the criminal after the fact and occasionally harass a young man for wearing a specific style of clothing or for having tattoos but that\'s beside the point anyway what I\'m trying to say is we have the right to defend our selves and we have the right to voice our opinion. We need a group to rise up and fight to weaken gun laws and strengthen the law abiding people of Canada and there\'s currently nothing keeping the thug with a gun that just wants some action or the pissed  off crack head from shooting you cause you fought back and yelled for help. And btw if you don\'t feel you need to carry a gun that doesn\'t give u the right to tell someone who does that they can\'t', 5, u'2014-01-19T05:25:15+0000']
