[u'Thanks Luke. \n"Dear Tyler, today is the day. Today is the day which will define your memories of tennis. Today is the culmination of all those years of hard work, accomplishments and broken dreams. The sweat, the tears, the blood. Were they all shed in vain? Were all the great moments for nothing? Will you be the type of person which will look back and think of what could have been? or will you be the person who left his mark? All those years weren\'t about the snazzy clothes, or the cool shoes, was it? One hasn\'t sacrificed so much in the game of tennis to merely have fun, because FUN is when you WIN. WINNING IS NOW, WINNING IS TODAY, because tomorrow DOESN\'T MATTER. EVERYTHING has to be left on the court today. You have to run to EVERY BALL, put all your technique, knowledge and strength into EVERY return, EVERY POINT, EVERY SET. TODAY IS ABOUT GLORY. TODAY IS ABOUT LEGACY. What will yours be?"\n-Lucas Cardona\n\nThank you to everyone that has ever motivated me, or supported me throughout my years of high school tennis.
