Can you assess their destination from their appearance- and will they have to get off the bus before you? If you answer yes to any of these questions, pick a different seat. In addition, I've learned that it's common to sit with the same gender whenever possible - unless they're cute, then the opposite is fair game. It's also incredibly flattering when an attractive person makes the decision to sit next to you, because you know all of the same things go through their mind when picking a seat, and if you're the #1 choice...well you're pretty much awesome.

WHAT a dilemma. So in this dream she asked her friend which one she wanted; neither. She wanted Church\'s Chicken. What is that? Among other things, I heard about her other friend\'s kid having their birthday party and Chuckie Cheese, and how both of this woman\'s "baby daddies" were there. Oh good lord.
