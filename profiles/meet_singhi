[u"This paper predicting that Facebook is going to lose 80% of its users by 2015 is making the rounds on the internet. So I read the paper and it irked me, for whatever reason. For anyone wanting to read the paper itself and not a blogger's opinion on the paper, here is the link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.4208v1.pdf\n\nFirstly, they're using an epidemiologic approach to explain the rise and predict the fall of an online social network. This might be novel for internet memes and viral videos, but this methodology cannot be used for a site like Facebook. This is because of the nature of virality on the internet. People are always looking for the next best dance move or the next cute cat meme, but we, as a collective, aren't constantly looking for the next Facebook. Most of us grumble about Facebook being dumb at times, but who are we kidding, we don't have a good alternative and we aren't looking for an alternative. We still logon everyday, look at pictures, make a status update, and leave a few comments. My biggest problem with the epidemiologic approach is that when a new disease breaks out, governments and groups around the world scramble to contain it. This leads to the characteristic curve seen in the paper. While there are lots of start ups and Google's looking to vie for the right to be your OSN, it's naive to think that those efforts are comparable to the billions spent around the world preventing a flu epidemic or mad cow. \n\nSecondly, the data they used is complex, not a simple cause and effect type data. Using Google trends is nice and easy, but they're way too many factors leading to how people Google and search for things. And moreover, the researchers don't substantiate why they should use it. They just say that it's been done for friendster by one group so it can be used for Facebook. This completely fails to account for the changes in googling habits and algorithms since the early 2000's. I'll list just a few. The biggest difference is that browsers have gotten smart. All the modern browsers have combined the search feature and the address bar, see the chrome omnibar which started the trend. So yes, you might have to search for Facebook once or twice. But once you visit the page, the browser will autofill the address so you don't have to keep searching. When friendster and MySpace were popular the search bar and the address bar were separate. Also, people have gotten smarter about how to use the internet. Yes, your grandma will keep googling Facebook on internet explorer 6. But your mom, your aunt, your crazy second cousin Rick now know how to use a computer. After years of you harping on them to stop googling everything, they've learned. Lastly, Google changes it's algorithm for search every other day. Using Google trends from even a few years ago is still looking back through countless algorithm changes, any one of which could mess with your data. They count one such change, but probably missed a few.\n\nAlso, let's not forget the rise of smartphones and tablets. Most people nowadays use the Facebook app and more and more traffic to Facebook is coming from the app and less from the desktop site. \n\nThis paper is nice in the novelty of their methodology, but applying it to Facebook is meaningless.", 3, u'2014-01-23T21:33:26+0000']

[u'My problem with people saying they\'ve done research into abortions or vaccinations or health care or immigration or any other talking point topic is that they haven\'t. They simply go to promyviewonly.blogspot.com and read someone else\'s "research" into the subject and go with it. Or they read one doctor\'s opinion on something and think they must be right and every other doc is crazy. They completely disregard the qualifications of the person writing the piece. The authors motivation. A doctor is not a statistician or an immunologist or an expert on the business of healthcare, neither is a journalist, and neither is the general public. And the people who write these opinions love to put charts and figures into their piece and then take a crack at analyzing the data. There\'s a reason why people spend decades learning how to analyze data. It\'s not simple, or trivial. Anybody that\'s ever written a real published research paper will tell you, getting data is one struggle, but analyzing the data is whole another level of headache. Every research paper you read not only tells you the data and it\'s meaning, but also all the statistical reasons why that data is credible and meaningful. These are things like p-values, and quartiles, and blocking, etc. Things that are not sexy to read about in a piece titled "How republicans want to kill your child and take your money". \n\nSo, no, you\'re not researching. You are simply reading one person\'s take on another person\'s take. Then when you spit those words out of your keyboard or mouth, all you\'re doing is offering your opinion on an opinion of an opinion. By this point, the original points of the actual research paper have been so distorted that it\'s borderline insulting. \n\nI\'m not saying reading articles online is bad, I spend a big chunk of my day doing that. But I don\'t post articles or use these articles to back up views because I know the difference between a primary and secondary source, and you should too. If you really want to research a topic, go to Google Scholar or PubMed or WebofScience and find primary sources. \n\nP.S. A textbook and encyclopedia(read Wikipedia) are by definition secondary sources. Internet, please stop using them as primary sources. \n\n/rant', 16, u'2013-11-18T02:21:43+0000']
